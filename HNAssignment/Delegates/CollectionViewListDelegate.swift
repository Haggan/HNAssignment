/**
 Discussion: There exists a problem in this solution that would show itself when the expected behaviour introduces
 infinite scrolling in the collectionView. The delegate would be responsible for knowing when we should load more
 data, but the dataSource would be responsible for downloading that data. It could lead to high coupling. But managing
 that relationship with good thought out protocols could fix it. I have not really thought it through yet.
